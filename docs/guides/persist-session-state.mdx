title: "Persist Session State"
description: ""
---

The Hyperbeam profile API allows you to persist session state including bookmarks, history,
passwords, and cookies which can be loaded into another session at a later time. This
allows you to resume sessions without requiring the user to open up web pages or
authenticate again.

<Note>
  Ensure you contact us at dev@hyperbeam.com to enable the pesistence feature
  for your API key.

## Saving a Session

In order to save a session, the `profile.save` parameter must be set to `true` when
[starting a Chromium session](/rest-api/dispatch/start-chromium-session).

### Example Request:

```curl
curl --request POST \
     --url https://engine.hyperbeam.com/v0/vm \
     --header 'Authorization: Bearer AUTH_VALUE' \
     --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     --data '{
 "profile": {
  "save": true
 }
}'
```

After the session is created, the response object will contain a `session_id` property that you must save
in order to load the session state again afterwards.

<Info>
  If you wish to save a session that was already persisted, you do not need to
  store the new `session_id` in your database. Instead, you can use the initial
  session's `session_id` to load/save that session. Therefore, you do not need
  to continually update the `session_id` corresponding to the session.
</Info>

### Example Response:

```json
{
  "session_id": "52f968cb-6739-4197-83d7-2305fe5d6f54",
  "embed_url": "https://vwdrccwgpv181powg61ggyvy.hyperbeam.com/Uvloy2c5QZeD1yMF_l1vVA?token=c8iw3SmQglOU0ugfLr3dWY2LalSKI_WOGUldEt8knbw",
  "admin_token": "51JOZEEcMp4trCwbpTS3jjQc0lSmeAZpPfxioDqe73U"
}
```

## Loading a Session

In order to load a previous session, the `profile.load` parameter must be set to the `session_id` you would like to resume
when [starting a Chromium session](/rest-api/dispatch/start-chromium-session).

### Example Request:


curl --request POST \
     --url https://engine.hyperbeam.com/v0/vm \
     --header 'Authorization: Bearer AUTH_VALUE' \
     --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     --data '{
 "profile": {
  "load": <session_id>
 }
}'
```

## Standard Usage Example

``` // Server
const response = await axios.post("https://engine.hyperbeam.com/v0/vm", {
  profile: "sessionID" // Pass the session ID to load the session and overwrite it when the session is over"
  
}, { headers });
```

## Standard CURL Example

3  ~ curl -X POST \  
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $HB_API_KEY" \

1. Profile: true -> Make sure to save a new profile
2. Delete the session
3. Pass 1d2df225-e1c5-4d94-8b95-1c6e75ef04ea (the session id from step 1) to load the profile, and also overwrite it when the session is over
```
## Advanced Usage Example

``` 
// Server
const response = await axios.post("https://engine.hyperbeam.com/v0/vm", {
  profile: { 
    load: "1d2df225-e1c5-4d94-8b95-1c6e75ef04ea" // Load the last session state 
    save: "1d2df225-e1c5-4d94-8b95-1c6e75ef04ea" // Overwrite the current session state
  }
}, { headers });
```

1. Create a session, and save it using save: true (create a new save)
2. Delete the session
3. Create a session, with save and load both set to the session ID of the original session. Setting load to the session ID saves it, and setting save to the session id overwrites it.
```

## Steps

```
Contact dev@hyperbeam.com to change your API permissions to enable persistence.
Use npm install to install the dependencies altogether and navigate to the examples you want to run for more information.
Set your API key by running the following command in your terminal:
## Notes

# Linux/macOS
export HB_API_KEY=your_api_key

# Windows
set HB_API_KEY=your_api_key
Replace your_api_key with your API key from the Hyperbeam dashboard.

Run npm run start, a server should be listening on port 8081.

Open http://localhost:8081 on your browser. You should be able to see the browser data being saved and accessed across multiple sessions.
```

## How Do We Persist Sessions?

When `profile.save` is set to `true`, we encrypt and store the Chrome profile of the session in Amazon S3.

This Chrome profile is associated with the `session_id` that was returned to you on session creation.

When `profile.load` is set to a session ID, we look for a stored Chrome profile that corresponds to that `session_id`, and decrypt and
load the Chrome profile if there is a match.

This results in bookmarks, history, cookies, and passwords being persisted.
