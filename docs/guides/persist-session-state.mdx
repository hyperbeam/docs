title: "Persist Session State"
description: ""
---

The Hyperbeam profile API allows you to persist session state including bookmarks, history,
passwords, and cookies which can be loaded into another session at a later time. This
allows you to resume sessions without requiring the user to open up web pages or
authenticate again.

<Note>
  Ensure you contact us at dev@hyperbeam.com to enable the pesistence feature
  for your API key.

## Basic Usage

In order to save a session, the `profile` parameter must be set to `true` when
[starting a Chromium session](/rest-api/dispatch/start-chromium-session).

<Warning>Saved sessions that have not been accessed for three months expire and are deleted automatically</Warning>

#### Example Request

```curl
curl --request POST \
     --url https://engine.hyperbeam.com/v0/vm \
     --header 'Authorization: Bearer AUTH_VALUE' \
     --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     --data '{
 "profile": true
}'
```

After the session is created, the response object will contain a `session_id` property that you must save
in order to load the session state again afterwards.

#### Example Response

```json
{
  "session_id": "52f968cb-6739-4197-83d7-2305fe5d6f54",
  "embed_url": "https://vwdrccwgpv181powg61ggyvy.hyperbeam.com/Uvloy2c5QZeD1yMF_l1vVA?token=c8iw3SmQglOU0ugfLr3dWY2LalSKI_WOGUldEt8knbw",
  "admin_token": "51JOZEEcMp4trCwbpTS3jjQc0lSmeAZpPfxioDqe73U"
}
```

In order to load and update a previous session, the `profile` parameter must be set to the `session_id` you would like to resume
when [starting a Chromium session](/rest-api/dispatch/start-chromium-session).

```curl
curl --request POST \
     --url https://engine.hyperbeam.com/v0/vm \
     --header 'Authorization: Bearer AUTH_VALUE' \
     --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     --data '{
 "profile": <session_id>
}'
```

This will load the profile associated with `<session_id>` and update its contents when the new session is terminated. Below is a code snippet that showcases a simple profile integration:

```js
app.get("/computer", async (req, res) => {
  // Get the session ID from a query parameter
  // In a real application you want to authenticate the user retrieve the session ID from your database
  let { session_id } = req.query; 
  let profile = true; // profile = true will create a new profile
  if (session_id) {
    try {
      await db.get(session_id);
      profile = session_id; // if session_id is valid, load and update the profile tied to that id
    } catch (e) {
      res.status(400);
      return;
    }
  }
  const settings = {
    profile,
    timeout: {
      offline: 10,
    },
    ublock: true,
  };
  const headers = {
    Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.HB_API_KEY}`,
  };
  let resp;
  try {
    resp = await axios.post("https://engine.hyperbeam.com/v0/vm", settings, {
      headers,
    });
  } catch (e) {
    console.error(e);
    res.status(501);
    res.send({ message: e.message });
    return;
  }
  const computer = resp.data;
  // if session_id was not defined, then a new profile was created and we want to store the session id tied to the new profile
  // otherwise use the old session id
  session_id = session_id || computer.session_id; 
  await db.put(session_id, {
    session_id,
    sites: [],
  });
  res.send(computer);
});
```

## Advanced Usage

For more granular control, you can specify separate profiles to load and overwrite. This is useful if you wish to create a new profile from an existing profile, without altering the original.


curl --request POST \
     --url https://engine.hyperbeam.com/v0/vm \
     --header 'Authorization: Bearer AUTH_VALUE' \
     --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     --data '{
 "profile": {
  "save": <session_id_1>,
  "load": <session_id_2>
 }
}'
```

## Standard Usage Example

``` // Server
const response = await axios.post("https://engine.hyperbeam.com/v0/vm", {
  profile: "sessionID" // Pass the session ID to load the session and overwrite it when the session is over"
  
}, { headers });
```

1. Create a session, and save it using save: true (create a new save)
2. Delete the session
3. Create a session, with save and load both set to the session ID of the original session. Setting load to the session ID saves it, and setting save to the session id overwrites it.
```

## Steps

```
Contact dev@hyperbeam.com to change your API permissions to enable persistence.
Use npm install to install the dependencies altogether and navigate to the examples you want to run for more information.
Set your API key by running the following command in your terminal:
## Notes

# Linux/macOS
export HB_API_KEY=your_api_key

# Windows
set HB_API_KEY=your_api_key
Replace your_api_key with your API key from the Hyperbeam dashboard.

Run npm run start, a server should be listening on port 8081.

Open http://localhost:8081 on your browser. You should be able to see the browser data being saved and accessed across multiple sessions.
```

## How Do We Persist Sessions?

When `profile` is set to `true`, we encrypt and store the Chrome profile of the session in Amazon S3.

This Chrome profile is associated with the `session_id` that was returned to you on session creation.

When `profile` is set to a session ID, we look for a stored Chrome profile that corresponds to that `session_id`, and decrypt and
load the Chrome profile if there is a match.

This results in bookmarks, history, cookies, and passwords being persisted.
