Hyperbeam roles are scoped permissions assigned to users. They are similar to Linux groups, where each role corresponds to one permission, and multiple roles can be assigned to a single user.

## Overriding default roles

You can override the default roles assigned to a newly connected user when creating the session:

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $HB_API_KEY" \
  https://engine.hyperbeam.com/v0/vm --data \
  '{"default_roles": ["control", "clipboard_copy", "cursor_data"]}'
```

## Toggling roles

You can toggle the roles of individual users dynamically. See [addRoles](/rest-api/session/add-roles) and [removeRoles](/rest-api/session/remove-roles) endpoints.
